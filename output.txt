eventPatches.1536163200.title: Probabilistic Functional Programming
eventPatches.1536163200.url: https://wiki.haskell.org/Probabilistic_Functional_Programming
eventPatches.1536163200.description: Probabilistic functional programming is a library for discrete random variables in terms of their distribution. A distribution represent the outcome of a probabilistic event as a collection of all possible values, tagged with their likelihood. It turns out that random variables establish a monad, namely a list monad where all items are equipped with a probability. A nice aspect of this system is that simulations can be specified independently from their method of execution. That is, we can either fully simulate or randomize any simulation without altering the code which defines it. Examples include dice games, the Monty Hall paradoxon and others.

eventPatches.1597831200.description: I recently moved to a different place without stable Internet so I had to go on a hiatus until the local ISP finally comes to my apartment and connects me to the Global Network. It was a rough time. I had a pretty severe stream withdrawal but finally I'm back! Let's celebrate and drink some tea!

eventPatches.1601719200.url: https://github.com/tsoding/wcc
eventPatches.1601719200.description: Low level language that compiles directly to WebAssembly. The goal of the project is to be as close to WebAssembly as possible yet providing nice abstraction mechanisms to speed up the development process. The target audience of the language is people who do [raw WebAssembly](https://surma.dev/things/raw-wasm/) development for recreational purposes.

eventPatches.1610272800.title: Programming in Ada
eventPatches.1610272800.description: Continue to learn more about [Ada Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)).

The plan for today:
- setup [ada-mode](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ada-mode.html) for Emacs
- learn how to use TLS sockets in Ada.
- see how to add TLS connection support to [ada-irc](https://github.com/erik/ada-irc) or maybe even start developing a custom IRC library
